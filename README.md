# Background
This work is founded upon my bachelor's thesis at Hochschule Zittau/GÃ¶rlitz. Its objective is to extract time series data representing ON/OFF events from raw data, where variations in active power serve as the basis for clustering. Essentially, this idea is rooted in event-based NILM methods.
## Time Series Clustering
The extracted time series will be initially grouped based on their mutual distances. Recognizing that similar sequences (time series) can differ in speed, the traditional Euclidean distance is inadequate for measuring their similarity. To account for time or phase shifts, we employ the DTW-Distance and its variant, Soft-DTW, as distance measurement algorithms. A specialized algorithm named "K-Shape," utilizing cross-correlation distance, can also classify time series based on their shapes. Typically used clustering methods are designed for data points with unrelated features. In this work, we utilize the K-means algorithm from the Python library "tslearn" for this purpose. These three methods will be independently applied to cluster 100 time series with values of k ranging from 3 to 8. We will compare the best silhouette scores and required times. Interestingly, for electrical load curves, K-means + DTW minimizes time while achieving a score of 0.66, similar to K-shape, which takes more time. The highest score is achieved with K-means + Soft-DTW, albeit at the cost of significantly longer computation time. In summary, the strategy involves initial clustering using K-Means + DTW, followed by a secondary clustering using K-means + Soft-DTW. The 4716 time series are grouped into nearly 700 clusters. For agglomerative clustering, we employ hierarchical clustering, and these clusters are eventually consolidated into 26 clusters. The final results are accessible in the "Clustering Results" folder.
## Time Series Classification
A 1D CNN model has been devised to tackle this multiclassification task for time series data. No further elaboration is required on this matter...
