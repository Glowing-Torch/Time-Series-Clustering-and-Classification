# Time-Series-Clustering-and-Classification
This work is based on my bachelorthesis in Hochschule Zittau/GÃ¶rlitz. It aims to extract the time series that represent an ON/OFF event in the raw data, in which the change of active power will be recorded and used as the feature of clustering. Essentially this idea is on the basis of event-based NILM methods. 
## Time Series Clustering
The extracted time series will firstly be clustered according to the distance between each other. Given that two similar sequences (time series) may vary in speed, the traditional euclidean's distance is not suitable to mesaure the similarity between them. Taking shift in time or phase into account the DTW-Distance and its variant Soft-DTW will be used as distance measurement algorithm. A special algorithm called "K-Shape" which uses cross-correlation distance is also able to classify the time series depending on their shape. The normally used Clustering Methods are for the data points consisting of several unrelated features. As the clustering algorithm in this work the K-means in Python-library "tslearn" specialize in this work. The three of these methods will be separately used for clustering of 100 time series with k from 3 to 8. The best sillhouette score and required time wil be compared. The fact is for the load curve of electricals K-means + DTW require minimum time while its score is 0.66, similar to the effect of K-shape which requires more time. The best score appears in K-means+Soft-DTW at the cost of very long calculation time. Above all, the strategy is firstly clustering with K-Mean+DTW and then second clustering with K-means+Soft-DTW. The 4716 time series is divided into near 700 clusters. For agglomerative clustering I use hierarchy clustering. These Clusters finally are merged into 26 Clusters. You can see the final results in the folder "Clustering Results".
## Time Series Classification
A 1d CNN model is designed to solve this multiclassification task for time series. Nothing more to say...
